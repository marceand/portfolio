I am an electrical engineer and Android developer with a passion for integrating hardware and software to create cutting-edege products. Currently employed as a Drone QC Engineer at Easy Aerial, I leverage my expertise to ensure the quality of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Previously, I honed my skills as an Android developer contributing to the development of apps for startup companies.

My other interests include running, swimming and reading many books.
